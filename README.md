# zkSync System Architecture

## Introduction
zkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that leverages zero-knowledge rollups (zkRollups) to provide low-cost and fast transactions. This document provides an in-depth look at the zkSync system architecture, detailing its components and their interactions.

## Overview
zkSync aims to enhance the scalability and usability of Ethereum without compromising on security or decentralization. The system is designed to handle thousands of transactions per second while maintaining the robust security of the Ethereum network.

## Key Components
The zkSync architecture consists of several key components:

1. [zkRollup](#1-zkrollup)
2. [zkSync Nodes](#2-zksync-nodes)
3. [Coordinator](#3-coordinator)
4. [Smart Contracts](#4-smart-contracts)
5. [Zero-Knowledge Proofs](#5-zero-knowledge-proofs)

### 1. zkRollup
zkRollup is the core technology behind zkSync. It batches multiple transactions off-chain and generates a succinct cryptographic proof (zkSNARK) that is then submitted to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed on-chain, resulting in lower gas fees and higher throughput.

### 2. zkSync Nodes
zkSync operates through a network of nodes responsible for various tasks:

- **Validator Nodes**: These nodes validate transactions and maintain the state of the rollup.
- **Data Availability Nodes**: They ensure that all data necessary to reconstruct the state of the rollup is available.
- **Aggregator Nodes**: These nodes collect transactions from users, bundle them into rollup blocks, and generate zkSNARK proofs.

### 3. Coordinator
The Coordinator is a crucial part of the zkSync architecture. It is responsible for orchestrating the operation of the zkSync network by:

- Sequencing transactions.
- Coordinating the generation and submission of zkSNARK proofs.
- Ensuring data availability.

The Coordinator ensures that transactions are processed in an orderly manner and that the state of the rollup is updated correctly.

### 4. Smart Contracts
zkSync relies on several smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum mainnet:

- **zkSync Contract**: This contract holds user funds and processes deposits and withdrawals.
- **Verifier Contract**: It verifies the zkSNARK proofs submitted by the zkSync network.
- **Governance Contract**: Manages protocol upgrades and parameter changes through decentralized governance.

These contracts provide the interface between the zkSync Layer 2 network and the Ethereum Layer 1 blockchain.

### 5. Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkSNARKs) are fundamental to zkSync's operation. They allow the network to prove the correctness of off-chain transactions without revealing their details. The zkSNARK proofs are efficient, enabling the system to maintain high transaction throughput and low latency.

## Transaction Flow
The typical flow of a transaction in zkSync is as follows:

1. **User Initiates Transaction**: A user submits a transaction to a zkSync node.
2. **Transaction Batching**: The node batches the transaction with others to form a rollup block.
3. **Proof Generation**: The aggregator node generates a zkSNARK proof for the rollup block.
4. **Proof Submission**: The proof is submitted to the zkSync smart contract on Ethereum.
5. **State Update**: Upon verification, the state of the zkRollup is updated, and the transaction is finalized.

## Security and Decentralization
zkSync ensures security through cryptographic proofs and the security of the Ethereum mainnet. Decentralization is achieved by allowing multiple nodes to participate in transaction validation and data availability.

## Conclusion
zkSync's architecture is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and decentralized solution for Ethereum. By leveraging zkRollups and zero-knowledge proofs, zkSync significantly improves transaction throughput and reduces costs, making it an ideal solution for decentralized applications (dApps) and users alike.
